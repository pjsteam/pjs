{"name":"p-j-s","tagline":"A JavaScript library that leverages Web Workers to provide parallelism when working with Typed Arrays","body":"A library to parallelize `map`, `filter` and `reduce` operations on typed arrays through the use of Web Workers.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n```\r\nnpm i p-j-s\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nIt's as simple as:\r\n```js\r\nvar pjs = require('p-j-s');\r\n\r\npjs.init({ maxWorkers: 4 }); // initialize the library\r\n\r\npjs(new Uint32Array([1,2,3,4]))\r\n.filter(function(e){\r\n  return e % 2 === 0;\r\n}).map(function(e){\r\n  return e * 2;\r\n}).seq().then(function (result){\r\n    // result is [4,8] a new Uint32Array\r\n\r\n    // if we are not using the library any more cleanup once we are done\r\n    pjs.terminate();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Operations\r\n\r\n### `map(mapper)`\r\nThe `map` operation invokes the `mapper` function for each element of the wrapped `TypedArray`. It produces a new array of the same type where each element is the result of the `mapper` function.\r\n\r\n### `filter(predicate)`\r\nThe `filter` operation invokes the `predicate` function for each element of the wrapped `TypedArray`. It produces a new array of the same type which only includes the original elements for which the `predicate` function returns `true` (or a _truthy_ value).\r\n\r\n### `reduce(reducer, seed[, identityReducer], identity)`\r\nThe `reduce` operation invokes the `reducer` function for each element of the wrapped `TypedArray` passing the value of the previous invocation as the first parameter (`current`) and the element as the second one.\r\n\r\nThe reduction is first performed in the Web Workers using `identity` as the intial value for `current`. The results from the Web Workers are collected and a new reduction is performed on them using `seed` and `identityReducer` function.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nYou can find out more by checking out the [complete API](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/wiki/API) and the How Tos in our [wiki](https://github.com/pjsteam/pjs/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n* Using [this great seed](https://github.com/mgonto/gulp-browserify-library-seed) project from [@mgonto](https://twitter.com/mgonto).\r\n* [@mraleph](https://twitter.com/mraleph) for [IR Hydra](https://github.com/mraleph/irhydra) and the help he provided to use it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

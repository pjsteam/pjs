## Discussing features
<a name="features"></a>
We would like the design for all features to get socialized via github issues. Please do this before you implement something so that we can all get on the same page of the feature and not waste your time, which we really appreciate.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a feature and a bug?
_Any bug fix which is a significant code contribution (say more than 10 lines of code), which introduces new APIs or which introduces breaking changes will be treated in the same way as we treat a [feature](#feature)._

The idea and some source code for this sample was taken from here:
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eternalcoding/archive/2012/09/20/using-web-workers-to-improve-performance-of-image-manipulation.aspx

To run the sample you must serve the **index.html** file using a local server. Otherwise a CORS error is thrown when manipulating the image inside the canvas.
